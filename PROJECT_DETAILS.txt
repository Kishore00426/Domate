Project Title: Domate

Abstract:
Domate is a comprehensive service booking and management platform designed to connect users with service providers efficiently. The application facilitates a seamless ecosystem for three distinct roles: Users, Providers, and Administrators. Users can browse categories, book services, manage their bookings, and save addresses. Service Providers have a dedicated dashboard to manage their offerings. Administrators possess full control over the platform, with capabilities to manage users, verify providers, oversee service categories and services, and configure system privileges through a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. The platform emphasizes security, internationalization, and a simplified user experience.
